This repository contains my work for the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition. The goal of the competition is to predict whether passengers on the Titanic transported to an alternate dimension or not based on various features.

## Competition Overview

## Description

In this project, I participated in the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition. The repository includes the following:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the data for machine learning.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
- Achieved a final accuracy of 81%, ranking within the top 11% of all participating teams.

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing EDA, data preprocessing, and machine learning models.
- `data/`: Dataset files used for the competition.
- `src/`: Source code and utility functions used in the project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-kaggle.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd titanic-kaggle`

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the EDA and machine learning process.
2. You can also run the notebooks interactively to reproduce the analysis.
