# Analyzing the Kaggle Titanic Spaceship Dataset

This repository provides an analysis of the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition dataset. The aim of this dataset is to predict whether passengers on the Titanic spaceship were transported to another dimension based on various features.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:

Data Exploration and Feature Engineering: The Numpy and Pandas libraries are utilized to explore and manipulate the dataset. Furthermore, mlxtend is used to implement Sequential Forward Floating, a wrapper method, for assisting in feature engineering

Data Visualization: Using the powerful library Plotly, create interactive charts for data exploration. Compared to other libraries, it is more helpful in intuitively understanding the data and visualizing the appearances of different features. Due to the static nature of GitHub web pages, please access this **[link](https://nbviewer.org/github/TicyYang/kaggle_spaceship_titanic_analysis/blob/3e811edfd9655242598b196f22950c2498a0ac3d/spaceship_titanic_analysis.ipynb)** to view the complete Plotly visualizations in Jupyter nbviewer. .

Machine Learning: The machine learning aspect involves constructing predictive models using libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Additionally, grid search methods are employed to compare and fine-tune hyperparameters.

### The versions of libraries used are as follows:  

- Python: 3.10.12  
- Numpy: 1.25.2  
- Pandas: 1.5.3  
- Plotly: 5.16.1  
- Mlxtend: 0.22.0  
- scikit-learn: 1.2.2  
- XGBoost: 1.7.6  
- LightGBM: 4.0.0
